# MSP Portal

The solution is directed to Managed Service Providers who are maintaining multiple FileWave Server instances in their environments.

The MSP Portal currently allows an administrator to:
* Catalog FileWave Servers.
* Monitor the status and display FileWave Server revision.
* Launch FileWave Admin directly from the MSP Portal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you deploy the project to production environment. Before starting with first command to deploy the solution please make sure that you read whole instruction.

### Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge and hands-on experience with Docker and Docker Compose.
* Machine in your data center running up-to-date Docker and Docker Compose.
* Location on this machine where internal database and log files will be persisted (later referred as `MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION`).
  * (**Windows only**) Depending on your Docker settings the location will most likely have to be inside your local user directory (e.g. `C:\Users\admin\`).
* External, off the machine backup of `MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION` location and `.env` file contents. You are responsible for configuring and managing backups, FileWave will not help you recovering lost MSP Portal data.
* (Optional) SSL certificate matching machine's host name in order to enable HTTPS communication.

### Important notes
* Minimum support version of FileWave Server that is able to provide online status and its current version is 13.0.0.
* Launching FileWave Admin from the MSP Portal will only work with compatible versions of FileWave Servers. FileWave Admin installed on your machine must be compatible with FileWave Server you're trying to connect to. Minimum supported version of FileWave Admin for this feature is 12.9.0.
* Enabling Kubernetes on the machine hosting the portal will very likely break the networking inside portal's containers. Please ensure that Kubernetes is disabled.
* All `docker-compose` commands require to be executed from the directory where MSP Portal release is unpacked.

### Installing

Following steps must be executed only once, during initial deployment of the solution. For upgrade instruction please refer to 'Upgrading' section.

1. Download and unpack the newest [release](https://github.com/fw-dev/msp_portal/releases) of MSP Portal.
2. Ensure that `MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION` location exists on the machine which will host the portal.
3. Go to the location where MSP Portal release is unpacked.
4. Open `.env` file in text editor and provide following required configuration options. Please note that filename starts with `.` hence the file is considered as hidden on Linux and macOS platforms.
   * `MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION`
   * `MSP_PORTAL_HOSTNAME`
   * `MSP_PORTAL_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
5. Start the solution by executing following `docker-compose` command.
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose_production.yml up -d

```
6. Create super user account with following `docker-compose` command and follow prompts. You'll be asked for super user username, email address (optional) and password twice.
```
$ docker-compose exec gunicorn /usr/local/bin/python /app/msp_portal/manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'root'): fwadmin
Email address:
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```
7. Test deployment entering hostname (`MSP_PORTAL_HOSTNAME`) and port 8000 in your browser (e.g. http://192.168.0.102:8000/). Please note that this is `http` not `https`. Log in with super user credentials.

Congratulations! You successfully finished the deployment.

### Configuring HTTPS

Please remember! Certificate must be matching machine's hostname.

In order to configure HTTPS for communication between the portal and your browser you need to copy private key and public key certificate files to `MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION` and configure filenames in `.env` file.
* `MSP_PORTAL_KEYFILE` must be PKCS#8 in PEM format.
* `MSP_PORTAL_CERTFILE` must be X.509 Certificate in PEM format.

If your deployment is already running you need to restart it by executing `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose_production.yml up -d` commands.

You can test HTTPS configuration by entering hostname (`MSP_PORTAL_HOSTNAME`) and port 8000 in your browser using HTTPS schema (e.g. https://192.168.0.102:8000). Please note that this is `https` not `http`.

## Upgrading

This section will describe steps to perform to upgrade from one version to another.

## Known issues
* FileWave Admin may be able to connect to incompatible version of FileWave Server. If FileWave Admin opens despite displaying the message about version incompatibility please close it. The possible results of interaction between incompatible versions of FileWave Admin and FileWave Server are undefined.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: Why are we creating MSP Portal?  
A: FileWave would like to improve the ability of Managed Service Providers to manage multiple instances of FileWave Servers for their end customers.

Q: Who can use it?  
A: The intent is to target Managed Service Providers, but there isnâ€™t a technical limitation that enforces this. Anyone who needs to handle multiple FileWave instances can benefit from using the portal.

Q: Is it possible to have multiple user accounts to access the portal?  
A: Super user can create accounts for the other users.

Q: How do I add my FileWave Servers to the portal?  
A: Go to **_Servers_**, press **_Add Server_** and enter all required information.

Q: What is supposed to happen when I add a server to my portal?  
A: Server will be displayed in the portal. There will be no operations done on the added FileWave Server.

Q: What is the recommended hardware to run the portal?  
A: Commodity hardware is good enough.

Q: Where is the information about servers (hostname, description, FileWave administrator username and password stored)?  
A: On the machine which is hosting your instance of the portal. Sensitive data like usernames and passwords are only used to automatically log into FileWave Server when Launch FileWave Admin feature is used.

Q: How often is online and version information updated?  
A: Every minute.

Q: How do I stop the solution?  
A: You can stop the portal by executing `docker-compose down` command.

Q: How do I remove the solution?
A: First, you need to stop the solution. Remove MSP Portal release directory. Remove the location where internal database and log files were persisted (`MSP_PORTAL_DB_HOST_LOCATION`).
